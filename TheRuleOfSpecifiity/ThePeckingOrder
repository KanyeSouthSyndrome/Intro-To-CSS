What is Specificity?
There is a hierarchical reorganization when .css is interpreted
-If two or more .css edits pull on the same .html element for changes,
  the 'selector' with the highest *Specificity Value* wins.

How does Specificity work?
I.Specificity Values
Ia.Inline Styles[Value of 1,000]
Ib.ID's[Value of 100]
Ic.Class/Psuedo-Classes/Attribute Selectors
  -[Value of 10]
Id.Elements/Pseudo-Elements
  -[Value of 1]
