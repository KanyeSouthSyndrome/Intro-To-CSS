/*A pseudo-class consists of a colon (:) followed by the pseudo-class name (e.g., :hover).
A functional pseudo-class also contains a pair of parenthesis to define the arguments (e.g., :dir()).
The element that a pseudo-class is attached to is defined as an anchor element (e.g., button in case button:hover).
Pseudo-classes let you apply a style to an element not only in relation to the content of the document tree,
but also in relation to external factors like the history of the navigator (:visited, for example),
the status of its content (like :checked on certain form elements), or the position of the mouse (like :hover,
which lets you know if the mouse is over an element or not).*/
